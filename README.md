# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Welcome to my prework study guide. I was motivated to build this project to reinforce the information I have learned, I forget things easily if I don't put them in to practice so this solves that problem! During the course of building this guide I have gained a base understanding of how HTML, CSS & javascript work.

## Usage

This study guide can be used for reminders on key information for HTML, CSS & Javascript. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
